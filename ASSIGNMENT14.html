        The Indian Army is the land-based branch and the largest component of the Indian Armed Forces.
        The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army, and its professional head is the Chief
        of Army Staff (COAS), who is a four-star general. Two officers have been conferred with the rank of field marshal,
        a five-star rank, which is a ceremonial position of great honour.

      <P>
        In 1776, a Military Department was created within the government of the East India Company at Kolkata.
         Its main function was to record orders that were issued to the army by various departments of the East India
          Company for the territories under its control. With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the government
           of the East India Company was reorganised into four departments, including a Military Department.
            The army in the presidencies of Bengal, Bombay and Madras functioned as respective Presidency Armies
             until 1 April 1895, when they were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience,
              it was divided into four commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras
              (including Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).
